# P6-txt-img_classification

## Dependencies
This project needs to run with python 3.12 to be able to use tensorflow2


## Summary
This project aims to develop and implement preprocessing methods for text and images to automatically classify consumer goods into different categories based on textual descriptions and provided images. You will analyze the data, use algorithms for feature extraction (such as SIFT, ORB, SURF, and CNN), and experiment with supervised classification techniques and data augmentation.

## Business objectives
- **Improving Efficiency**: Automate the classification of consumer goods to reduce manual effort and time in processing large datasets.
- **Enhancing Customer Experience**: By accurately categorizing products, it is possible to improve product discoverability for users, leading to a better shopping experience.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Provide insights from data analysis that can inform business strategies, such as inventory management or marketing campaigns.
- **Supporting Scalability**: Create a system that can handle increasing volumes of product data as the business grows.
- **Cost Reduction**: Minimize costs associated with manual classification and improve resource allocation by leveraging automation.

## Learning objectives
- **Data Preprocessing Skills**: Develop an understanding of techniques for preprocessing text and image data to prepare them for analysis and classification.
- **Feature Extraction**: Learn to apply algorithms such as SIFT, ORB, SURF, and CNN for extracting meaningful features from images and text.
- **Classification Techniques**: Gain experience with supervised classification methods, exploring different models and their applications in categorizing data.
- **Data Analysis**: Enhance the ability to analyze results through visualizations and performance metrics, allowing to interpret the effectiveness of models.
- **Implementation of Data Augmentation**: Understand how to use data augmentation techniques to improve model performance by increasing the diversity of your training data.
- **API Interaction**: Familiarize with collecting and managing data using APIs, which can be valuable for integrating additional data sources into a project.
- **Communication Skills**: Improve the ability to document a process and present findings clearly and effectively, both in written form and during a presentation.
